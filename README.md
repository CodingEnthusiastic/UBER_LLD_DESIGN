# üöó RideFlow - Advanced Ride Sharing Platform

## Overview
RideFlow is a comprehensive ride-sharing platform built with clean architecture principles, demonstrating the implementation of multiple design patterns and SOLID principles. This system provides a robust foundation for a scalable ride-sharing service.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
- **User Management**: Abstract User class with Rider and Driver implementations
- **Vehicle System**: Factory pattern for vehicle creation with multiple types
- **Ride Management**: Complete ride lifecycle management
- **Matching System**: Pluggable driver matching strategies
- **Fare Calculation**: Decorator pattern for flexible pricing
- **Notification System**: Observer pattern for real-time updates

### Design Patterns Implemented

#### 1. Strategy Pattern
- **Purpose**: Pluggable driver matching algorithms
- **Implementation**: `DriverMatchingStrategy` interface with multiple implementations
- **Strategies**:
  - `NearestDriverStrategy`: Finds closest available driver
  - `BestRatedDriverStrategy`: Prioritizes highest-rated drivers
  - `SmartHybridStrategy`: Combines distance, rating, and completion rate

#### 2. Factory Pattern
- **Purpose**: Vehicle creation and configuration
- **Implementation**: `VehicleFactory` class
- **Benefits**: Centralized vehicle creation with consistent configuration

#### 3. Singleton Pattern
- **Purpose**: Single point of control for ride management
- **Implementation**: `RideManager` class
- **Benefits**: Ensures single source of truth for system state

#### 4. Observer Pattern
- **Purpose**: Decoupled notification system
- **Implementation**: `NotificationService` with multiple observers
- **Observers**:
  - `RiderApp`: Rider-specific notifications
  - `DriverApp`: Driver-specific notifications
  - `AdminDashboard`: System-wide analytics

#### 5. Decorator Pattern
- **Purpose**: Flexible fare calculation with add-on features
- **Implementation**: `FareCalculator` interface with decorators
- **Decorators**:
  - `SurgePricingDecorator`: Applies surge multiplier
  - `DiscountDecorator`: Applies percentage discounts
  - `LoyaltyDiscountDecorator`: Loyalty-based discounts

## üåü Unique Features

### 1. Smart Hybrid Matching Algorithm
- Combines multiple factors for optimal driver selection
- Weighted scoring: Distance (40%) + Rating (40%) + Completion Rate (20%)
- Provides better overall user experience

### 2. Loyalty Reward System
- Automatic discounts based on ride history
- Tier-based rewards: 5% (10+ rides), 10% (20+ rides), 15% (50+ rides)
- Encourages customer retention

### 3. Scheduled Rides
- Book rides in advance
- Automatic driver assignment at scheduled time
- Perfect for airport trips and planned journeys

### 4. Real-time Analytics Dashboard
- Live system metrics
- Revenue tracking
- Driver utilization statistics
- Performance monitoring

### 5. Multi-Vehicle Support
- Bikes, Autos, Sedans, SUVs
- Different pricing models per vehicle type
- Capacity-based matching

## üîß SOLID Principles Implementation

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each class has one reason to change
- `Rider` manages rider-specific data
- `Driver` manages driver-specific operations
- `FareCalculator` handles only fare calculations

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- System is open for extension, closed for modification
- New matching strategies can be added without changing existing code
- New fare decorators can be plugged in seamlessly

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All strategy implementations are interchangeable
- Decorators can be substituted without breaking functionality
- User subclasses (Rider/Driver) can be used polymorphically

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Focused interfaces for specific roles
- `Observer` interface is minimal and specific
- `DriverMatchingStrategy` has single method responsibility

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- `RideManager` depends on `DriverMatchingStrategy` abstraction
- Notification system depends on `Observer` interface
